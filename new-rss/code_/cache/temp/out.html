Lindypress

<p>&lt;p&gt;Just
a
brief
note
that
for
the
past
couple
of
days,
you
might&amp;rsquo;ve
been
unable
to
buy
books
on
&lt;a
href=“https://lindypress.net”&gt;LindyPress.net&lt;/a&gt;
if
you
are
in
the
United
States,
Canada
or
Australia
(which
is
a
lot
of
you).
&lt;strong&gt;This
has
now
been
fixed,
so
you
can
place
your
orders
now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
issue
was
that
there
was
a
silent
API
update
that
kept
addresses
from
validating
states
and
provinces.
&lt;em&gt;Note
that
if
your
order
placed,
it&amp;rsquo;s
all
okay,
this
is
only
for
people
for
whom
the
site
would
not
let
place
an
order.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s
a
chance
that
there
might&amp;rsquo;ve
been
another
country
which
might
not
be
validating
correctly,
so
if
you
input
your
entire
address
and
get
a
non-descript
error
message,
just
tell
me.
I&amp;rsquo;ve
tried
most
countries
we
get
the
most
orders
from
and
they
validate
fine.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Title:
I’ll
visit
South-East
Europe
(Greece,
Albania,
Montenegro,
Constantinople)
this
Summer</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll
be
in
south
eastern
Europe
this
summer
(of
2023)
in
late
June
and
early
July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific
plans
are
still
in
the
air,
but
I&amp;rsquo;ll
be
visiting
Greece,
Albania,
Montenegro
and
possibly
the
European
side
of
Turkey.
I&amp;rsquo;ll
also
be
in
Kosovo,
and
while
I
know
I
have
some
fans
in
Serbia,
I&amp;rsquo;m
not
sure
I
can
cross
into
Serbia
proper
easily
since
the
US
accepts
Kosovo
as
independent,
but
I
believe
that
being
there
would
be
an
illegal
entrance
into
Serbia
in
the
eyes
of
the
Serbian
government.
Not
sure
about
the
specifics.
You
can
elucidate
me,
but
either
way
I&amp;rsquo;ll
be
in
the
region.
If
you
guys
start
shooting
each
other,
either
way,
that
leg
of
the
journey
will
be
canceled
so
play
nice
until
after
this
summer!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I
do
know
some
people
who
live
in
or
frequent
the
region.
Now
is
your
time
to
&lt;a
href=“https://lukesmith.xyz/contact”&gt;contact
me&lt;/a&gt;
if
you&amp;rsquo;ll
be
there
then.
People
I
don&amp;rsquo;t
know
are
welcome
to
contact
me
if
they
want
to
arrange
a
small
public
meet-up,
which
I
am
theoretically
open
to.
I
will
be
with
other
people
in
a
group
though,
so
don&amp;rsquo;t
expect
to
separate
me
from
my
group
for
too
long.
I&amp;rsquo;m
sure
they&amp;rsquo;d
come
along
if
you&amp;rsquo;re
not
creeps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I
have
a
short
list
of
Orthodox
Churches
and
monastaries
I
intend
to
visit
(although
this
is
not
a
pilgrimage,
and
the
people
I&amp;rsquo;ll
be
with
are
not
Orthodox),
and
also
some
other
attractions.
Suggestions
of
places
to
go,
whether
natural
or
man-made,
religious
are
secular
are
welcome.
Hints
for
good
and
cheap
living
in
the
region
are
invited
as
well,
since
I&amp;rsquo;ll
again
be
with
several
people
and
I
want
to
economize
for
everyone
since
we
may
be
around
several
weeks.
I
think
for
a
good
portion
of
the
time,
we&amp;rsquo;ll
just
be
hanging
out
in
the
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact
me
quick
though,
because
we&amp;rsquo;re
about
to
start
buying
tickets
and
making
concrete
plans
and
such.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
